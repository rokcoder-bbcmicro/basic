# Nonograms (Hanjie)
## Written in QB64 (Phoenix Edition)

My first project using QB64 (having only used APPLE II BASIC and BBC BASIC up to this point - and that was many decades ago)

1. Download and unzip the [nonograms ZIP file](https://github.com/rokcoder-qb64/nonograms/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Download and install QB64pe (Phoenix Edition) from their [github](https://github.com/QB64-Phoenix-Edition/QB64pe)
3. Run QB64pe.exe
4. Ensure the `Run` / `Output EXE to Source Folder` option is selected
5. Load `NONOGRAMS.BAS` and hit f5 to build and run the EXE

Once the **nonograms.exe** file has been built, you can run the game directly from that in future.
